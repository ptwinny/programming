Desired Features In A Pollution App
Consider offering the following features in your pollution app:

The app should access reliable measurements of metrics like AQI and show the pollution level to users.
It should have a map integration to show pollution levels based on userâ€™s current location.
App users should be able to search for other cities and get pollution data as well.
The app should offer recommendations for handling a polluted environment, e.g., what type of mask to wear, etc.
A user-friendly UI is important.
A pollution app should feature push notifications.
Optionally, you can offer in-app purchases. Plan on offering your app on the web, Android, and iOS.
